# Sports Team Performance Prediction

A comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project focused on predicting sports team performance using ODI cricket match data. This project analyzes various factors that influence match outcomes, including toss decisions, batting order strategies, and venue-specific performance metrics.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project aims to predict sports team performance by analyzing historical ODI cricket match data. Using statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, we explore patterns in team performance across different venues and match conditions to provide insights into factors that contribute to winning outcomes.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Toss Impact Analysis**: Examine the correlation between winning the toss and match outcomes at specific venues
- **Batting Order Strategy**: Analyze the effectiveness of batting first vs. second at different grounds
- **Venue-Specific Performance**: Study team performance patterns across various cricket grounds
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs to visualize performance trends
- **Statistical Insights**: Comprehensive analysis of match results and team strategies

## 📊 Datasets

The project uses three main datasets:

1. **WC_players.csv**: Player information including IDs and country affiliations
2. **ODI_Match_Results.csv**: Match outcome data including results, margins, toss decisions, and venue information
3. **ODI_Match_Totals.csv**: Match scoring data including team totals, overs played, and run rates

## 🔍 Analysis Focus Areas

### 1. Toss Decision Impact
- Analysis of match outcomes based on toss decisions at The Oval
- Statistical correlation between toss wins and match victories
- Venue-specific toss advantage patterns

### 2. Batting Order Strategy
- Performance comparison between teams batting first vs. second
- Venue-specific analysis (Birmingham ground focus)
- Win/loss ratios for different batting strategies

### 3. Performance Visualization
- Pie charts showing win/loss distributions
- Ground-wise performance comparisons
- Statistical trend analysis
